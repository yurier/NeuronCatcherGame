I am thrilled to present the game I designed for the "Young Strathclyder" student activity. The BackyardBrain's Heart and Brain Box made this game possible. At the core of its gameplay, one can use oculomotor nerve potential to control the player's actions, and it serves as an educational tool on how neurotechnology can be harnessed in various ways.
Our primary goal is to ignite a passion for science and technology in young minds. We aim to inspire future scientists by showing them the real-world applications of what they learn in textbooks. This game is a perfect blend of fun and education, designed to motivate and educate our young participants about neurotechnology's endless possibilities.
